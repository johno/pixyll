Jekyll is a tool for transforming your plain text into static websites and 
blogs. It is simple, static, and blog-aware. Jekyll uses the 
[Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/liquid/reference/basics) templating
language and has builtin [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
and [Textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) support.

It also ties in nicely to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
