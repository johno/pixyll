There is a significant amount of subtle, yet precisely calibrated, styling to ensure
that your content is emphasized while still looking aesthetically pleasing.

All links are easy to [locate and discern](#), yet don't detract from the [harmony
of a paragraph](#). The _same_ goes for italics and __bold__ elements. Even the the strikeout
works if <del>for some reason you need to update your post</del>. For consistency's sake,
<ins>The same goes for insertions</ins>, of course.

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Here's an example of some ruby code with line anchors.

{% highlight ruby lineanchors %}
# The most awesome of classes
class Awesome < ActiveRecord::Base
  include EvenMoreAwesome

  validates_presence_of :something
  validates :email, email_format: true

  def initialize(email, name = nil)
    self.email = email
    self.name = name
    self.favorite_number = 12
    puts 'created awesomeness'
  end

  def email_format
    email =~ /\S+@\S+\.\S+/
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some CSS:

{% highlight css %}
.foobar {
  /* Named colors rule */
  color: tomato;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some JavaScript:

{% highlight js %}
var isPresent = require('is-present')

module.exports = function doStuff(things) {
  if (isPresent(things)) {
    doOtherStuff(things)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="m0 p0 bg-blue white">
  <h3 class="h1">Hello, world!</h3>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](https://basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](https://basscss.com/), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Footnotes!

Markdown footnotes are supported, and they look great! Simply put e.g. `[^1]` where you want the footnote to appear,[^1] and then add
the reference at the end of your markdown.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Antoine de Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite></footer>
</blockquote>


### Tables

Tables represent tabular data and can be built using markdown syntax.  They are rendered responsively in Pixyll for a variety of screen widths.

Here's a simple example of a table:

| Quantity | Description |     Price |
|----------+-------------+----------:|
|        2 |      Orange |     $0.99 |
|        1 |   Pineapple |     $2.99 |
|        4 |      Banana |     $0.39 |
|==========|=============|===========|
|          |   **Total** | **$6.14** |

A table must have a body of one or more rows, but can optionally also have a header or footer.

The cells in a column, including the header row cell, can either be aligned:

- left,
- right or
- center.

Most inline text formatting is available in table cells, block-level formatting are not.

|----------------+----------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Default header | Left header          |     Center header      |                     Right header |
|----------------|:---------------------|:----------------------:|---------------------------------:|
| Default        | Left                 |        Center          |                            Right |
| *Italic*       | **Bold**             |   ***Bold italic***    |                      `monospace` |
| [link text](#) | ```code```           |     ~~Strikeout~~      |              <ins>Insertion<ins> |
| line<br/>break | "Smart quotes"       | <mark>highlight</mark> | <span class="green">green</span> |
| Footnote[^2]   | <sub>subscript</sub> | <sup>superscript</sup> |     <span class="red">red</span> |
|================+======================+========================+==================================+
| Footer row                                                                                        |
|----------------+----------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------|

Happy writing.

[^1]: Important information that may distract from the main text can go in footnotes.

[^2]: Footnotes will work in tables since they're just links.
