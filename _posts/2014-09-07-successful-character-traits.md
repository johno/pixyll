Kiki is turning three next month. I have been reading a book called [How Children Succeed][book-link]. It listed these 7 essential character traits children need for them to be successful in life. I looked up thier dictionary definitions on Merriam-Webster.

**Grit**
> firmness of mind or spirit :  unyielding courage in the face of hardship or danger

**Curiosity**
> one that arouses interest especially for uncommon or exotic characteristics

**Self-control**
> restraint exercised over one's own impulses, emotions, or desires

**Social intelligence**\*
> the ability to get along well with others, and to get them to cooperate with you

**Zest**
> a lively quality that increases enjoyment, excitement, or energy

**Optimism**
> an inclination to put the most favorable construction upon actions and events or to anticipate the best possible outcome

**Gratitude**
> a feeling of appreciation or thanks


Now the real question is how do I teach Kiki to possess all those qualities.

\* = Webster does not have a definition for social intelligence so I looked it up on Google.
