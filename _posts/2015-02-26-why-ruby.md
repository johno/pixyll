When I started my internship at Junto Studio, I was told that learning to code
was similar to learning a new language, like Portuguese, or French. Therefore,
it was good to start with one that I could broadly practice and use.
They recommended **Ruby on Rails**, which is a web application framework for Ruby.

In few words, Ruby on Rails offers shortcuts written in Ruby that lets you build
web applications really quickly. Compared with the little I know from other
languages, Ruby is easy to understand, fast, and simple. It’s also very readable,
and it provides countless of resources to learn*.

In addition, there’s a huge community of people willing to help you.
When you start to spend more time in [Stack Overflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) than anywhere else on the
Internet, you can be sure that you’re truly learning something!

As a first approximation to the frightening thought of learning to code,
starting with Ruby tore down some walls regarding not only programming itself,
but also education. Traditional education discards failure as a property of
success, and who am I kidding, it’s also tedious and boring.

Through my internship at Junto, I’ve learned the fun way: by messing things up
and pushing fears down. Along the way, I’ve learned a bit of Ruby, Html
and CSS, and I’m definitely eager to learn more (this didn’t happened to me
at school very often).

Teaching myself how to code opened new doors not only in terms of programming
something for the future, but also in dismantling conceptions from the past.
I’m more aware now of the power of trial and error and of the gift of failure.
Because in the end, that’s exactly how I’ve learned: by **trying and failing**.

Disentangle yourself from the traditional education paradigms. Self-teaching
imposes no boundaries on the process, and it can actually be fun!

If you are passionate with an idea, don’t wait for someone to build it for you!
**Take the leap** and start learning to code.

Some of the resources we recommend for starting to learn Ruby on Rails are:
