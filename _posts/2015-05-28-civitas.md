I met Charles through Capital Factory’s mentor network.
He is currently working on [Civitas Learning](http://www.civitaslearning.com/),
a company that focuses on using
case-specific predictive models to help more students graduate
and succeed every year. In other words, they analyze data that colleges already have
and use it to recommend to students what combination of courses they should take
next semester, or recommend to teachers what they should teach.

According to CrunchBase, they have raised over $28M and are more
than 100 employees.

Prior to that, he discovered a passion for education while teaching high school
students on the weekends during his undergraduate days at Stanford, and went on
to founding multiple successful education start-ups.

As someone who wants to make an impact in the future of education, I had a lot of
questions for Charles. Here's what I learned:

### Solve a burning need

Many products in the ed-tech space never take off because they're
only *nice-to-haves*.

Find a burning need. A problem that people already know they have, and are already
investing resources to solve.

Many of us become education entrepreneurs because we went through
years of schooling
and think "I know a thing or two I can do to make this better".
This is a double-edged sword because having a solution for a problem you have
doesn't necessarily mean other people share the same problem.

Talk to as many customers as you can, find what struggles they share.
Keep in mind that not all schools work in the same way.

### The "it's impossible to sell to schools and universities" mentality is a myth

Sales in the education market is not black magic. If you have a product that
adds real value you just have to sell it like you would other software products.

Paint a very clear picture of how your product will benefit the schools. A good
example is: "If you use our product, one year from now, your attrition rate will
go down by 20%, student satisfaction will be up by 15%, and you will be saving
10 hours of work per week."

Counterintuitively, people that have **not** sold in education before are good
at this, because this is how enterprise sales is done in most other industries.

### Biggest challenges for the future of Education

##### 1. Access to content

With so much information being created every day – according to Eric Schmidt,
every 2 days we create as much information as we did from year 0 up to 2003 –
one of the biggest challenges we face is how to make sense of all that content
for an educational context.

##### 2. Classroom experience

A wider acceptance of technology in the classroom is set to reinvent how we think
of classrooms themselves.

We're starting to see more innovation in the classroom experience with schools
like [Acton Academy](http://www.actonacademy.org/) and
[Alt School](https://www.altschool.com/).

##### 3. Use data to make better decisions

Schools create massive amounts of data: content in new courses created,
videos watched, problems solved, discussions both online and offline.

We can even track how taking a particular class impacts a student's professional
success 10 years down the road.

All of this data is set to reinvent the decision-making process in education.
This is what they're solving at Civitas Learning.

### Closing Thoughts

This is a very exciting time to be an education entrepreneur.
The industry is ripe for disruption and it's very insightful to talk to people
like Charles who are in the front-line of making change happen.

We're already seeing great innovations, many thanks to technology and
many thanks to questioning old educational paradigms.
