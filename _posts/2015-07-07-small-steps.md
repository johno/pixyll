Learning is about small steps. Ever since we're born. Our first
words, our first sentence, our first story. We're always building on what we
learned yesterday, and with time, these learnings compound.

Don't rush it.

We tend to underestimate what we can accomplish in a decade, but overestimate
what we can accomplish in a year.

Enjoy the small steps you're taking today.
