If you haven't jumped onto the #30DaysWild bandwagon, you are not too late.  The challenge is to do something outside or 'wild' every day in June and we are jumping onboard.  Our focus is on the more urban side, living in Brighton, our first day found us in London.  London is one of the greenest and biggest cities in the world.  We are on holiday with some dear family and are staying right beside Hyde Park.  Our first day of wild challenge found us in the Princess Diana Memorial Park.
