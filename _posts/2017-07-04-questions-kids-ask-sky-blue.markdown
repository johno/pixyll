![blue-sky-clouds.jpg](http://doingandlearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/blue-sky-clouds.jpg)I've been thinking about questions for a while both on this [blog](http://doingandlearning.com/20-questions/) and elsewhere.

I love asking our boys questions and I love engaging with their questions.  Like most kids, they ask great questions and crazy questions in almost equal amounts.  I love giving them answers that are age appropriate, enjoying the challenge of simplifying complex knowledge to make it understandable.

To help me with this (and maybe you?), I've started to develop a series of YouTube videos to accompany my explanations.  I'll be working on these questions over the coming months and am always excited to get more ideas.  I have questions from our boys but there are probably questions that they are not asking yet, so please share your questions with me in any way you like :).



## Why is the sky blue?



This is a question I get asked quite regularly.  We're getting close to Son1 being able to understand it but we're still not quite there.

Things you need to know to understand this:




    
  * Light is not one solid colour;

    
  * When light hits different mediums it scatters;

    
  * In different circumstances, some light scatters more than others.



I've tried to explain those things in the video but explanations are better understood when we can engage with them.  I want our kids to do something to explore their knowledge rather than passively accept answers (even if they do come with cool animated videos).



### Experiment: Splitting 'single' colour light into lots of colours



So, I wanted to design a simple experiment for my kids to have a go at.  I want them to see that they could shine light that seems to be a single colour and see that it's made up of the whole spectrum.

Equipment:




    
  * A mirror

    
  * A light source

    
  * A shallow dish with some water

    
  * A piece of paper



Set-up (loving my amazing drawing skills):

As the light from the torch passes through the water and bounces off the mirror, it splits into the colours of the rainbow.

### What next?



Where would you take this next?  What questions might your kids ask as you play with these things?

Let me know if you enjoyed this and please share any ideas you might have.  I was asked the other day, 'How do you make sand?' and I think that might be next.
