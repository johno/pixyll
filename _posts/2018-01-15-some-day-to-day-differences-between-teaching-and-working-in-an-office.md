Today I started my new job and for the first time since I left university that hasn't involved teaching. I'm really excited about my development career and the next steps but I thought it would be interesting to notice the differences between working in a classroom and working in an office. I've kept my eyes open today and these are some of the things I've noticed.





  * Being able to go to the loo when I need to.


  * Having one desk and not losing time forgetting things in my office, classroom, staff room, department office, tea room, colleagues room, etc.


  * Being responsible for my own things and not the resources and books for 30 others.


  * Having to actively decide when to start work, have a break, finish work rather than movement being controlled by bells and published timetables.


  * Being surrounded and interacting entirely with adults during the work day.


  * Being given the time to read the compliance documents that I need to read.


  * Access to quality tea and coffee when needed.


  * Consistent energy levels - not the same adrenaline fueled performances.


  * A general positivity about the work that is happening from everyone.


  * Lots of accepted geekiness and long-standing in jokes.


  * Intrinsically motivated - wanting to produce quality for good - feels less driven by others' agendas.



I'm not imagining that I've arrived in utopia but similarly I was ready for this change.

I spent most of today reading documents, getting to know some things about our major on-going projects and getting my development machine setup.  I also got to do the crossword, geek out about sci-fi novels and try to get an arduino-based theremin up-and-running.  It was fun day and I had enough energy to come home, read with the boys and hang out with my beautiful wife.

I know it's only the first day but it was a good one.
