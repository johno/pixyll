I am a huge fan of [A Fresh Cup](https://afreshcup.com/), the weblog of Mike Gunderloy, where he posts a bunch of cool stuff that he found around the web.  Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I'm going to start blogging my own links.

* [Webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) - Webview is a tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++/Golang
* [git push baby products](https://www.schneems.com/2018/04/30/git-push-baby-products/) - Richard Schneeman wrote about a bunch of awesome baby products for the tech dad.
* [MacOS monitoring the open source way](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/04/4696/) - Some nice tools around monitoring your MacOS machines
* [Infection Monkey - an automated pentest tool](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey) - Interesting that the open source ecosystem is really growing in security
* [Rubyâ€™s Rack Push: Decoupling the real-time web application from the web](https://bowild.wordpress.com/2018/05/01/rubys-rack-push-decoupling-the-real-time-web-application-from-the-web/) - Rack is coming around to the Websockets craze in a big way
* [https://github.com/square/sudo_pair](https://github.com/square/sudo_pair) - Plugin for sudo that requires another human to approve and monitor privileged sudo sessions
