For those of you who are unaware, there has been a heated debate (war) going on between supporters of Vim and supporters of Emacs for years now, these are not the only contenders, there are supporters of [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) who pitch in on the debate too and many more, but these are the biggest runners in my opinion.

Possibly, there may be a few of you out there (sadists) who still like to use [ed](https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/manual/ed_manual.html#). And for those of you who don’t, I challenge you to use it for a day without throwing your keyboard.

And if you ever meet someone who tells you Vim and Emacs are a step backward then issue the same challenge to them.

## Vim

This tool is an extremely powerful text editor in the corrected hands, and an extremely effective random character generator in the wrong hands (it’s `:wq` to exit FYI).

### Background

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (Vi IMproved) as the title suggests, is an improvement of the text editor [Vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/), an editor designed for the Unix operating system. Initially released in 1991 it gained traction due to how light it was. It is popular among tech specialists as it is installed by default on most Unix based operating systems, and can be used through the command line.

### First Impressions

The first thought that entered my head when I saw Vim being used was ‘This looks complicated’ it seemed like some kind of arcane witchcraft that I didn’t understand. The next thought was ‘Holy moly this is efficient!’.

I picked Vim up first a couple of years back when pairing with a fellow dev, who swore by Vim, he would fly around files using all the shortcuts like it was breathing, faster than I would be able to use any graphical text editor.

The most daunting part of this for me was how will I effectively edit text when I can’t remember the shortcuts, so he pointed me to https://vim-adventures.com/ an online game where you can iteratively learn the shortcuts, I would recommend this for people who want to use Vim but need a few layers of complexity to be explained.

Once I had the hang of the basics, and at this point, I was editing files at about a tenth the speed I usually would be, but I was learning.
