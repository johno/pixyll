These are the three technical books I read in 2020.
- Functional Programming in C#
- Architecture Patterns with Python
- Growing object oriented software guided by tests

## Functional Programming in C#
I've been coidng in C# at my current job. I like it so far.
* Static typing
* Linq
The book introduces some of the best functional programming concepts in C#.

## Architecture Patterns with Python
The best parts about the book: at the end of the chapters: Pros and Cons.
I wish I have read it when I was a Software Engineer at Dreamworks animation because ..
In Python not much architecting going. Afraid of big design up front. Just Get Sh*t done attitude. Ends up in Ravioli code.

## Growing object oriented software guided by tests
First heard about the book on Ruby Rogues podcast where they had the book club.
Also at my current job I do a lot of test automation.
The book has capters on testing and some adivce which I think were some of the best.
