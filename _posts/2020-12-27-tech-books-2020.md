Here are the three technical books I read in 2020.
- [Functional Programming in C#: How to write better C# code](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp)
- [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecture-patterns-with/9781492052197/)
- [Growing object oriented software guided by tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/)

## Functional Programming in C\#
Nowadays I've been coding in C# at my current job. The experience has been pretty good so far. I have done a lot of Python in the past. C# is a statically typed programming language which is in contrast to Python's dynamically typed nature. I found static typing of C# pretty nice. I also found myself reaching for LINQ included with the standard library when I need Python's expresiveness.

C# is mostly an object-oriented programming language. In recent years functional programming paradigm has been steadily gaining popularity among many programming communities. So I wanted to learn how to apply some of the functional programming techinques at my current job. The book introduces some of the best functional programming concepts. The edition I have at the time of this writing is the first edition and the code examples are in C# 7. It's a highly technical book and it took me a few months to get through and digest some of the information in it.

## Architecture Patterns with Python
A few years ago, I read TDD in Python book written by the same author. That book had served me well with me doing TDD in Django. I learned several techniques with writing unit tests and how to use mock library. When this new book came out I had to read it. The online version of the book is available for free.  Yet, I purchased the book from the publisher’s website to help support the authors.

I haven’t been writing Python code that much lately. But I have worked on large Python code bases in my previous jobs, how they can become hard to maintain over time. In my experience, my Pythonistas co-workers tend to be apprehensive towards big design up front. In fact they tend to frown upon attempts to do any sort of design in the name of saying “We don’t do Java in Python”. This attitude serves well in small to medium size projects. However the bigger projects tend to accumulate complexity. As a result they become this unmaintainable ‘big ball of mud’ mentioned in the book. The book introduces some of the architectural patterns to help alleviate messy situations in large Python code bases.

As the book title suggests the patterns are architural patterns and not to be confused with [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) design patterns. Here are a few of the patterns and the components the books talked about. Unit of work pattern, CQRS, bounded context as in DDD, event driven pattern, Strangler fig pattern to name a few.

What I also like about the book is that it is pretty honest about the tradeoffs of said patterns. At the end of each chapter it has a section that talks about pros and cons of the pattern in the chapter. The code examples in the book use Flask in an e-commerce setting. It has appendix on how to adapt UoW pattern for Django models.

## Growing object oriented software guided by tests
A number of years ago I heard about the book on [Ruby Rogues podcast](https://devchat.tv/podcasts/ruby-rogues/) in one of their book club episodes. I bought the book since then and it has been sitting on my book case collecting dust. It's one of the must read program design and testing books on my list. The book examples are in Java and I have been away from Java for a long time. 

At my current job I do a lot of test automation and so I finally decided to read through it. The code examples implement an auction sniper GUI app in Java swing. For me nuggets of wisdom the book has along the chapters are real gold. The chapters in part 3 are on testing and it has some of the best adivce I have read on writing maintainable test code and testing asyncronous code.
