It's been a hot minute (as my teenager daughter says it) since I started at HashiCorp as a developer on the Terraform Cloud team (we are [hiring like crazy](https://grnh.se/896abd501)) and while the firehose at work has soaked me completely - I hadn't had much exposure to many of the other HashiCorp Products other than [Packer](https://packer.io/).

Turns out we eat a lot of our own dogfood at Hashi and the devops flow that folks like I use to get code into production utilizes Hashi products under the hood. After asking dumb question after dumb question internally about how things worked, I figured it would be a better idea to learn the products themselves. And what better way to do that than run them at home?

Most of the devices on my home network are already <s>frankensteined </s> provisioned for other purposes and configuration of those felt like it would be more of a challenge so I went and got a bunch of Raspberry Pis instead and networked them all together. This is the story of how that all went down.
