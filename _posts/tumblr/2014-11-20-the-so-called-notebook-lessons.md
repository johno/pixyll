“Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his minds, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expressions of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed.”– Ralph Waldo Emerson
Reading an essay such as Self Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson is a beautiful but exhausting experience. It is the kind of literature that changes its meaning according to your present reality. You can read it a hundred times and always discover new pieces that didn’t appear to be there at first. It is not only a remembering experience but the possibility of updating your map. A map, as a constantly growing data base of coordinates, i.e. knowledge.
The idea (and feeling) of revisiting old knowledge and interpreting it from scratch inspired the project I call “Notebook Lessons.” Stand up and look at your bookshelf, grab an old journal or book and sink yourself into the words in front of you. Try to remember the exact moment you wrote that down and then just focus yourself to get out as much meaning of those sentences as possible.
As an example, let me share with you three personal notebook lessons that amazed me when reading it again: 
3 random but meaningful thoughts that are worth to keep in mind.
1.You can only change something in yourself, if you are aware of it.
2.Worrying about a problem takes as much space in your head as actually thinking on something to solve it. And do in it, of course.
3.Never make decisions under the HOLT EFFECT (understood as been hungry, angry, lonely or tired).
Take the call. Many times great inspiration and accurate lessons where written by our old selves, but it only makes sense now. Learning opportunities are everywhere and it is only up to the each explorer to find them. In Emerson’s words, you may err in the expression of your own perceptions but you know such things are so. Meaning will arise one way or another. Unlearn, relearn, it doesn’t matter, but always learn and keep expanding your map.
