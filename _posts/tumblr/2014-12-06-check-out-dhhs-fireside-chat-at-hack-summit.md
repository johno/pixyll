Key takeaways:
Be extremely protective with your time. (No push notifications, work remotely, phone on not disturb). All this, to achieve “Flow”.
Great performers don’t work 10 times more, they choose what to work on 10 times better. Take your time to think about what you will focus on.
When building an application, don’t be too worried about performance, most applications won’t reach the point where they break because of performance issues ( >20 Million people ). Worry about how fast you can iterate, build new features.
Thank you DHH and Hack Summit for doing this!
Note: Hack Summit is a virtual conference for programmers.
