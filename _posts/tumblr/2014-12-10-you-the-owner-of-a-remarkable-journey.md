“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if your were to live forever.” - Mahatma Gandhi 

Let me tell you something. I think it is a mistake that we live constantly thinking in the future. We have learn to have a mindset of: Tomorrow I will be better. Tomorrow I will achieve what I want to. Tomorrow I will not make the mistakes I did today. The thing is, humans see tomorrow as forgiveness to all the decisions we can’t take with certainty today. The tomorrow gives us a sight of relief and the confidence that there is a second chance to do things.
The world we live today, constantly ask us to keep track, save and share everything we do. To be cool, you have to upload photos of your lunch on Instagram, post your mood at Facebook, and let everyone know how your love relationship is going on Twitter. I am not here to deny that such things will feel good (at a point), but it is not all about that. With this selfish thought we have forgotten how unique the opportunity of focusing on the present is, because it is the only time that is accurate and that we actually live. It is very usual that most of the people begin the week thing about what they will do on Friday night or for their next vacations that are in four months. They think of everything unless on the fact that they will go to work that day, and that the opportunity of doing an execelent performance or learning something is in their hands.
I believe that each person is the one and only capable of doing of their life what they want. Why? Because no on else is living your life but you. With this in mind I started a challenge a few month ago. The whole purpose was to enjoy each day and realize that each second is valuable. After brainstorming for several days, I created a strategy. In post-its I wrote about two things: personal challenges and fun stuff I like to do. Things like smiling to 10 strangers, not using technology for a day, or eating my favorite dish. I took one each morning and spent the rest of the day trying to full fill it. All the time focused on the objective of making myself aware that each day has something meaningful. The truth? It wasn’t easy, but that is the beauty of doing something that is difficult to oneself. Take as no negociable the opportunity of appreciating the present. Again, why? Because in the present you can find the clearest version of yourself. Who you where when you had six years? Maybe pictures can be a visual memory, but you won’t remember that much. Who will you be in six years? You may have an idea of where you want to get, but it is that, only an idea.Don’t wait for the cosmos to align and then feel ready to make things happen. No, as cliché as it sounds, your life is only one and it is up to you of making it remarkable… not only a sum of days that end up being nothing.
