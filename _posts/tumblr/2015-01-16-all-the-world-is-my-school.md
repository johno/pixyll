By Majo Crespo 
One of my biggest learnings has been recognizing the fact that learning is everywhere. The old days in which we believe that school was the best and only place to learn, are changing. Instead, a revolution of alternative education and amazing methods to seek knowledge are creating an unstoppable flow. 

But, why? 
Some have finally understand that there is no perfect formula for learning that fits all. We are not robots, we don’t have to be the result of an industrial production, we don’t have to learn the same things and be like everyone else. These people have opened their eyes and became aware of the endless amount of learning opportunities in our everyday life. 
I consider myself one of those, who understood that learning (and knowledge) is not the result of going to school and having a teacher at the front of the class. It embarks much more because yes, learning is everywhere. But let me stop all this ambiguity and instead give you some examples of how I have come to see all of this. In other words, let me share with you what I have learned. 

#1 Creating learning communities



I have find an immense amount of value by surrounding myself with people that it is as eager in seeking knowledge as me but probably different in everything else. Life becomes monotone when you surround yourself with people who is at your same level, by the simple fact that nothing moves forward.



Learnings communities are everywhere, not only institutions. A family, a group of friends, or work peers. For me, learning communities are the best way to explore, connect and get completely out of your comfort zone. You become constantly challenged both physically and intellectually. And every day is an opportunity of doing meaningful things. 



#2 Life is made of perception



Let me tell you a story. When I was around fifteen years old I used to hate the rain. A grey sky and water all over was not my favorite combination. One rainy day I met a man who was a gardener and told me how blessed he felt, because the whole work of the month depend on that rain. After that day I couldn’t hate rain anymore. 



My point is that what for you is true, anything such as principles, beliefs or social conventions; for other is not. And that, can be proved by traveling around and meeting new people, because you get to realize two main things: how much your know and how much you still need to learn. 


#3 First focus on yourself



Any (really any) barrier, yes, even physical barriers are set by anybody else than oneself. 



Some weeks ago I was asked the question: “If you could change something of yourself, what would that be?”. My answer was mainly about blaming others of why I was one way or another, the stress and constrains such people put in my life, etc. 



But we kept talking and I realize that the only thing that was happening is that by finding others responsible of my problems, it became a fair excuse that, from time to time it made me forget the power I have (and that we all do) of changing things. Nothing is one way only. So feel free to understand things your way and keep moving forward.



None of this happened inside a traditional classroom. Yes, “All the world is my school… and all humanity is my teacher.” – George Whitman 



Let us know your learning’s too, we are eager to learn from you!
