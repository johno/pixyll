YOU MUST BE REJECTED BY ANOTHER PERSON AT LEAST ONCE, EVERY SINGLE DAY.

Have you been in a situation where you were paralyzed by fear? Like when the girl of your dreams was walking towards you, or your childhood hero was in the same room as you. You want to approach them, talk to them, and impress them with your charisma. Instead, as you make excuses crafting “the perfect plan”, the opportunity passes, and you’re left empty handed. Do you remember the last time this happened to you?

Now imagine yourself, perceiving exactly the same nerves, but feeling confident in your ability to overcome them. You approach this person, connect with them, and leave feeling completely satisfied yourself. That is what Rejection Therapy is all about. 

Rejection Therapy is a technique to train your brain to stop bending to the will of your fears. The only thing you have to do is get rejected by another person at least once, every single day, for 30 days straight. Yeah, you heard right. 30 days of exposing yourself by making unreasonable or eccentric requests to strangers, all with the purpose of rewiring your brain to conquer your fears. Its main goals are:

1. To be more aware of how irrational social fears control and restrict our lives
2. Smash the tyranny of fear and reap the treasures (treasures include wealth, relationships and self-confidence)
3. Learn from, and even enjoy rejection
4. To not be attached to outcomes, especially when it involves the free agency of other people
5. Permit yourself to fail

I’m a huge believer that you must work proactively on both your strengths and weaknesses to become a better person. So, since I’ve never been good at handling rejection, I will start the 30-day rejection challenge. In the following posts, I’ll be giving you updates about what I did and how it turned out.

I’m sure this will be extremely difficult for me, since I’ve always had trouble handling rejection. Just thinking about getting rejected once gets my heart pumping. So I’m doing this. Do you want to join me? Send me an email at 


Onwards!
