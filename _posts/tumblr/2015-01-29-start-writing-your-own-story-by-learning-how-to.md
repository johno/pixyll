For someone who prefers words over math and literature over physics, the thought of learning to code was utterly scary. My practical abilities were very close to none, and my comprehension of basic computer science was practically non-existent (seriously, though; I spent my Computer classes at school playing games and writing improvised stories). Nevertheless, life can be a series of fortunate coincidences. And after overhearing programming conversations, reading articles, and exploring the Internet, I stumbled with a coding post on Meta Notes.

When such a perfect tapestry of events, people and chance knocks at your door, you can’t just let the opportunity fade. And so I wrote them an email. We met for an interview, which was more of a friendly dialogue about life and our personal pursuits, and soon after, I started aninternship at Junto Studio. There were very few things that I was sure of at the
time, but I was completely certain that I wanted to learn how to code.

### Programming is just like writing 

Although I’ve been learning to program for only a
couple of months now, I’ve stumbled with some decisive lessons that I’d like to
share with you. Overall, I’ve discovered that programming is just like writing. Here, let me explain what I mean. 

If you think about it, both writing and coding strive
to be creative and precise endeavors that rely on a structured approach to
accomplishing a task. They both aim at doing so with an economy of language,
and turn out to be problem-solving processes where there’s no single perfect
solution. Writing is a form of art because it’s
an experience, and so is coding. _It’s the period of time when the transformative process of feeling, imagining and
envisioning happens._

### And just like prose, code tells a story. 

While writing (or programming), you use the results of
other works to build up something significant, and you combine innumerable
resources to create something out of nowhere. As a result, a coder can be
regarded as an essayist whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
style. His main tool, language, is the architecture behind much of what we
experience. Imagine everything we could discover by understanding this
architecture a bit more! 

I’m aware, though, that this is not an accurate portrayal
of the general perception of programming. Actually, relating
programming to sheer, manual labor is a common mistake I’ve comitted myself. In
fact, is a subtle mistake that stops many people from even trying to learn it. But what if we change the narrative and recognize coding as a creative
pursuit? As a dialogue between you, your imagination, and the minds of your
users…? 

### Also… it’s a liberal art (or at least it should be!)

According to Wikipedia, “grammar, rhetoric, and logic
were the core of the liberal arts”. And believe me or not, this sounds a lot
like coding! In a traditional education program, students get fixated on
grades, and memorization is practically embedded on the curriculum. Programming,
on the other hand, is much more like real life: you’re never done, you can
always make something better, and you will never find a single, isolated
solution to a problem.

Now, here are the main lessons I’ve learned after this
two-month adventure: 

1. Coding has taught me **introspection** Trying to figure out how
the computer encodes things has helped me to inquire on my own insights. 

2. When you are working in
a project that you truly love, **momentum just
builds**, and somehow, you eventually do whatever it takes to learn (working
at very late night hours, trying risky moves just to see if something works,
and diving deep in countless internet sites in search of answers, are just some
examples…) 

3. **Being patient pays off.** For someone who
writes cathartically, coding has taught me how to regulate my emotions. I won’t
lie to you: it can be frustrating at times, but programming is a great teacher
at thinking first (and thinking again), and reacting second. 

4. Coding is valuable not
because everyone is doing it, but because it’s
[fun](http://www.metanot.es/hacking-the-prototype-mindset-fun-fail-fast)…
And great inventions emerge from precisely that: experimentation and fun. 

5. Being **surrounded by friends** that are willing
to help me even with minor details has been incredibly helpful.  Not only for the paths they clear and the
light they shed, but for the support they’ve given me along the way. 

6. And last but not least, I’ve
learned to focus on a problem, think through it rationally, and try to
persistently find methods to solve it (you don’t have to be an engineer after
all, you just have to learn to think like one!) 

Happy debugging!
