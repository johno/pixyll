There’s never enough time to learn everything you want. And it always seems like you already have things to do in the time you do have.

So, what are 3 learning techniques that can help us optimize our learning?

### Podcasts

Podcasts are great to listen while you’re cooking, eating, showering, commuting, walking the dog, going to the bathroom, getting ready to sleep. Basically, there’s always time for a podcast.

#### The Bike Shed and Giant Robots by thoughtbot

(The Bike Shed is my favorite one. They’re 9 episodes in, and in the first one they introduced me to Sandi Metz’ rules, which I still think about constantly. Giant robots is not very technical, but provides great insights into the culture and vision of one of the best Rails consultancies out there.)

#### Ruby 5 By Code School

(Big emphasis on what’s new this week in Rails. Really condensed.)

#### Ruby on Rails podcast by Sean Devine

(The original one. High level/low level, there’s content for everyone)

#### RubyRogues by DevChat.

(Aaron Patterson, David Brady, James Edward Gray II, and Peter Cooper as panelists in the first episode. Cool episode about Service Oriented Architectures at Square)

### Remote Book Clubs. Everyone reading a different book.

When there’s a new and complex subject you want to learn more about, what better way than to do it from all angles possible? But you might be thinking, I don’t have the time.

This is why we’ve formed a remote book club, where everyone reads a different book on the same topic. Then, we all write summaries and do a small workshop on Google Hangouts to share what we learned.

The amount of insights you gain from approaching the same problem from different perspectives is incredible. Get 3 or 4 people together, and give it a go! You’ll read 4 books with the time cost of 1.

### Build up a learning streak.

I’m on day 15 of spending 30 minutes every day learning Angular.js. There are days where I’m not in the mood for learning at first, but I’ve made a commitment to myself to keep this up for at least 21 days.

Inspired by a Jerry Seinfeld, who used to write an X on his calendar the days he wrote at least one joke. This commitment to building a streak technique, is a great way to keep yourself learning.

The more people you can involve in your commitment, the better. At our company, there are many of us doing 21-day challenges to learn new stuff. This helps build a culture of learning, where we encourage and keep each other accountable.
