I'm Joe, a software developer currently working at NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Working there since 2016 as a Apprentice Developer to my current position as a Junior Developer.

I specialize in .Net Core and Asp.Net, programming mainly in C# and F#, with a sprinkle of JS/HMTL/CSS. In my spare time I like to play video games, do Gunpla and further my knowledge as a software dev.
