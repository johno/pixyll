I am an embedded systems developer and a Linux enthusiast, both as a user and as an active contributor to the Linux kernel.

I was born in Spain, but I moved almost a decade ago to Austria because I wanted to live in the Alps.
Almost all my hobbies that have nothing to do with embedded systems consist of activities in the mountains: climbing, trail running, backcountry skiing, hiking... just anything that gives me a feel of freedom and a connection to nature. That helps me to keep a good physical a mental balance, which in my opinion is key to success.

But I guess you could not care less about my hobbies, so I will tell you what I can offer you with this blog. I have been working with embedded systems for more than a decade, covering from the first steps of hardware design up to userspace application programming. But my main field of interest has always been the middle layers: FPGAs, microcontrollers and most recently the Linux kernel, where I contribute both professionally and as a hobbyist.
Over the years I have come up with some good practices and also hacks to improve the quality of my work in those areas, and that is what I would like to share with everyone who is interested. I will also talk about projects I am working on and from time to time I would like to wander a bit and talk about some stuff that has nothing to do with the development. In the end that is my personal blog, isn't it?
