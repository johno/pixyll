Hi!  I'm Kevin (and that's my beautiful wife).  I'm a husband, dad, developer, coffee-lover, who hails from Northern Ireland but lives and works in the south of England.

After 13 years working in education, teaching Maths and helping others think about that - I've retrained as a developer.  

In January 2018, I began my new career and my new role.  I'm really excited about this and will blog here about things I'm learning.  There are some legacy posts from other things, feel free to read those if you're bored.
