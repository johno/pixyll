My name is Yan Pye Aung. I grew up in [Myanmar][myanmar-wiki], matriculated from [TTC][ttc-wiki].
Then I went to [CCNY][ccny-website] and got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

I now live in Los Angeles, California, USA. I'm married and have an amazing daughter, named Kiki. I write software for a living and I am interested in small business and entrepreneurship.

I love movies and talking about sports. What I also love is traveling and outdoors. Every couple of years I like to visit my hometown, [Yangon][ygn-wiki], in Myanmar with my family.

If you want to connect with me please drop me a few lines.
