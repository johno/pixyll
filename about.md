Hi, I'm Brent McConnell.  I am currently employed as a Cloud Solution
Architect with Microsoft where I help customers and partners migrate workload to
Azure.

I am an open source advocate and have spent much of my career working for
companies with a large open source component.  Previous to Microsoft I've worked
at ...

* CloudBees as a Solution Architect helping customers understand DevOps and use
  Jenkins for CI/CD.
* CollabNet in Professional Services where I worked with customers to setup
  Subversion SCM.
* Novell as a Marketing Manager working on the open source projects Kablink and
  iFolder, both of which I don't think are around anymore.  BTW, this is my only
  forray into the dark worlds outside typical engineering roles.
* Hewlett Packard as a Partner Engineer helping partners utilize HP solutions
  to their fullest potenial in their product offerings
* Alcoa as a programmer where I started this never ending adventure in
  technology.
