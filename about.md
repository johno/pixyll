This one is a blog about information technologies, and about those IT topics that I find exciting such as **Data Analysis**, **Knowledge Discovery**, or **Enterprise Systems**. But over all it is about **autonomous** and **quick** ways of **starting up** things. Therefore we will talk and use technologies such as `GitHub`, `Jekyll`, `jsFiddle`, `knitr`, the `R` ecosystem, `Python`, `yhat`, etc.  

Shall we discuss these topics any further? Just contact me.
