## 1. Questions

**Define what we are looking to answer.**

1. What question you are looking to answer?
2. Why does this question matter?
3. What does the enterprise hope to achieve from this answer?

---


## 2. Data


1. Do we have data that will answer this question?
2. Where did we get the data?
3. How was the data sampled?
4. How was the data obtained?
5. How did you explore the data?

## 3. Analysis

Based off of the question(s), which best describes the answer(s) we are looking for?


**Are we looking at what has all ready happened?**

In this case we are simply looking to explain what happened in the past using *descriptive statistics techniques*.

* Decision Trees
* Histograms
* Scatterplots


**Are we looking trying to predict what will happen?**

In this case we are simply looking to explain what happened in the past using *supervised learning techniques*.

1. How did you model the data?
2. Why you chose to model it that way?
3. How did you fit the model?
4. How did you validated the model?
5. How you know the results make sense?



**Are we exploring the data to find patterns?**

Unsupervised Learning Techniques

## 4. Interpret

How you know the results make sense?

How you would communicate the results to others?

What did you learn?

If you were going to continue this work, what next steps you would take with this project?

#### Executive Presentation

This is the general outline and flow of communicating results to the pertinent stakeholders.  

1. **Title Slide** Title, Question as sub-title, and names of project owners.

2. A description of the business situation and problem. Go over why we looked to answer the initial question and where this fits into the organization.
3. A clear statement of your predictive model, coefficients, and interpretation of those coefficients. Be sure to carefully explain anything in your model that might be viewed as counterintuitive.
4. Your predicted collected revenue for the totalpay variable in the test set.
5. Any relevant graphs that might help provide some insights.
6. A brief overview of your modeling process
7. Key issues, risks, and success factors if the company decides to implement this model
8. A Conclusion/Summary slide or two including Recommendations & Next Steps
