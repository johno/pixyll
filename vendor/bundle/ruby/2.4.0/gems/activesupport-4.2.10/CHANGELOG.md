## Rails 4.2.10 (September 27, 2017) ##

*   No changes.


## Rails 4.2.9 (June 26, 2017) ##

*   Fixed bug in `DateAndTime::Compatibility#to_time` that caused it to
    raise `RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Time` when called on any frozen `Time`.
    Properly pass through the frozen `Time` or `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` object
    when calling `#to_time`.

    *Kevin McPhillips* & *Andrew White*

*   Restore the return type of `DateTime#utc`

    In Rails 5.0 the return type of `DateTime#utc` was changed to `Time` to be
    consistent with the new `DateTime#localtime` method. When these changes were
    backported in #27553 this inadvertently changed the return type in a patcn
    release. Since `DateTime#localtime` was new in Rails 4.2.8 it's okay to
    restore the return type of `DateTime#utc` but keep `DateTime#localtime` as
    returning `Time` without breaking backwards compatibility.

    *Andrew White*

*   In Core Extensions, make `MarshalWithAutoloading#load` pass through the second, optional
    argument for `Marshal#load( source [, proc] )`. This way we don't have to do
    `Marshal.method(:load).super_method.call(sourse, proc)` just to be able to pass a proc.

    *Jeff Latz*

*   Cache `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#to_datetime` before freezing.

    *Adam Rice*

*   `AS::Testing::TimeHelpers#travel_to` now changes `DateTime.now` as well as
    `Time.now` and `Date.today`.

    *Yuki Nishijima*


## Rails 4.2.8 (February 21, 2017) ##

*   Make `getlocal` and `getutc` always return instances of `Time` for
    `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` and `DateTime`. This eliminates a possible
    stack level too deep error in `to_time` where `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`
    was wrapping a `DateTime` instance. As a consequence of this the internal
    time value in `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` is now always an instance of
    `Time` in the UTC timezone, whether that's as the UTC time directly or
    a representation of the local time in the timezone. There should be no
    consequences of this internal change and if there are it's a bug due to
    leaky abstractions.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add `DateTime#subsec` to return the fraction of a second as a `Rational`.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add additional aliases for `DateTime#utc` to mirror the ones on
    `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` and `Time`.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add `DateTime#localtime` to return an instance of `Time` in the system's
    local timezone. Also aliased to `getlocal`.

    *Andrew White*, *Yuichiro Kaneko*

*   Add `Time#sec_fraction` to return the fraction of a second as a `Rational`.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add `ActiveSupport.to_time_preserves_timezone` config option to control
    how `to_time` handles timezones. In Ruby 2.4+ the behavior will change
    from converting to the local system timezone, to preserving the timezone
    of the receiver. This config option defaults to false so that apps made
    with earlier versions of Rails are not affected when upgrading, e.g:

        >> ENV['TZ'] = 'US/Eastern'

        >> "2016-04-23T10:23:12.000Z".to_time
        => "2016-04-23T06:23:12.000-04:00"

        >> ActiveSupport.to_time_preserves_timezone = true

        >> "2016-04-23T10:23:12.000Z".to_time
        => "2016-04-23T10:23:12.000Z"

    Fixes #24617.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add `init_with` to `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` and `ActiveSupport::TimeZone`

    It is helpful to be able to run apps concurrently written in successive
    versions of Rails to aid migration, e.g. run Rails 4.2 and 5.0 variants
    of your application at the same time to carry out A/B testing.

    To do this serialization formats need to be cross compatible and the
    change in 3aa26cf didn't meet this criteria because the Psych loader
    checks for the existence of `init_with` before setting the instance
    variables and the wrapping behavior of `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`
    tries to see if the `Time` instance responds to `init_with` before the
    `@time` variable is set.

    To fix this we backported just the `init_with` behavior from the change
    in 3aa26cf. If the revived instance is then written out to YAML again
    it will revert to the default Rails 4.2 behavior of converting it to
    a UTC timestamp string.

    Fixes #26296.

    *Andrew White*

*   Fix `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#in` across DST boundaries.

    Previously calls to `in` were being sent to the non-DST aware
    method `Time#since` via `method_missing`. It is now aliased to
    the DST aware `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#since` which handles
    transitions across DST boundaries, e.g:

        Time.zone = "US/Eastern"

        t = Time.zone.local(2016,11,6,1)
        # => Sun, 06 Nov 2016 01:00:00 EDT -05:00

        t.in(1.hour)
        # => Sun, 06 Nov 2016 01:00:00 EST -05:00

    Fixes #26580.

    *Thomas Balthazar*


## Rails 4.2.7 (July 12, 2016) ##

*   Fixed `ActiveSupport::Logger.broadcast` so that calls to `#silence` now
    properly delegate to all loggers. Silencing now properly suppresses logging
    to both the log and the console.

    *Kevin McPhillips*

*   Backported `ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel`. Assigning the
    `Rails.logger.level` is now thread safe.

    *Kevin McPhillips*

*   Fixed a problem with ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.titleize calling capitalize
    on nil.

    *Brian McManus*

*   Time zones: Ensure that the UTC offset reflects DST changes that occurred
    since the app started. Removes UTC offset caching, reducing performance,
    but this is still relatively quick and isn't in any hot paths.

    *Alexey Shein*

*   Prevent `Marshal.load` from looping infinitely when trying to autoload a constant
    which resolves to a different name.

    *Olek Janiszewski*


## Rails 4.2.6 (March 07, 2016) ##

*   No changes.


## Rails 4.2.5.2 (February 26, 2016) ##

*   No changes.


## Rails 4.2.5.1 (January 25, 2015) ##

*   No changes.


## Rails 4.2.5 (November 12, 2015) ##

*   Fix `TimeWithZone#eql?` to properly handle `TimeWithZone` created from `DateTime`:
        twz = DateTime.now.in_time_zone
        twz.eql?(twz.dup) => true

    Fixes #14178.

    *Roque Pinel*

*   Handle invalid UTF-8 characters in `MessageVerifier.verify`.

    *Roque Pinel*, *Grey Baker*


## Rails 4.2.4 (August 24, 2015) ##

*   Fix a `SystemStackError` when encoding an `Enumerable` with `json` gem and
    with the Active Support JSON encoder loaded.

    Fixes #20775.

    *Sammy Larbi*, *Prathamesh Sonpatki*

*   Fix not calling `#default` on `HashWithIndifferentAcess#to_hash` when only
    `default_proc` is set, which could raise.

    *Simon Eskildsen*

*   Fix setting `default_proc` on `HashWithIndifferentAccess#dup`

    *Simon Eskildsen*


## Rails 4.2.3 (June 25, 2015) ##

*   Fix a range of values for parameters of the Time#change

    *Nikolay Kondratyev*

*   Add some missing `require 'active_support/deprecation'`

    *Akira Matsuda*


## Rails 4.2.2 (June 16, 2015) ##

*   Fix XSS vulnerability in `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode` method.

    CVE-2015-3226.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Fix denial of service vulnerability in the XML processing.

    CVE-2015-3227.

    *Aaron Patterson*


## Rails 4.2.1 (March 19, 2015) ##

*   Fixed a problem where String#truncate_words would get stuck with a complex
    string.

    *Henrik Nygren*

*   Fixed a roundtrip problem with AS::SafeBuffer where primitive-like strings
    will be dumped as primitives:

    Before:

        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("Hello").to_yaml  # => "Hello"
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("true").to_yaml   # => true
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("false").to_yaml  # => false
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("1").to_yaml      # => 1
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("1.1").to_yaml    # => 1.1

     After:

        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("Hello").to_yaml  # => "Hello"
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("true").to_yaml   # => "true"
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("false").to_yaml  # => "false"
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("1").to_yaml      # => "1"
        YAML.load ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new("1.1").to_yaml    # => "1.1"

    *Godfrey Chan*

*   Replace fixed `:en` with `I18n.default_locale` in `Duration#inspect`.

    *Dominik Masur*

*   Add missing time zone definitions for Russian Federation and sync them
    with `zone.tab` file from tzdata version 2014j (latest).

    *Andrey Novikov*


## Rails 4.2.0 (December 20, 2014) ##

*   The decorated `load` and `require` methods are now kept private.

    Fixes #17553.

    *Xavier Noria*

*   `String#remove` and `String#remove!` accept multiple arguments.

    *Pavel Pravosud*

*   `TimeWithZone#strftime` now delegates every directive to `Time#strftime` except for '%Z',
    it also now correctly handles escaped '%' characters placed just before time zone related directives.

    *Pablo Herrero*

*   Corrected `Inflector#underscore` handling of multiple successive acroynms.

    *James Le Cuirot*

*   Delegation now works with ruby reserved words passed to `:to` option.

    Fixes #16956.

    *Agis Anastasopoulos*

*   Added method `#eql?` to `ActiveSupport::Duration`, in addition to `#==`.

    Currently, the following returns `false`, contrary to expectation:

        1.minute.eql?(1.minute)

    Adding method `#eql?` will make this behave like expected. Method `#eql?` is
    just a bit stricter than `#==`, as it checks whether the argument is also a duration. Their
    parts may be different though.

        1.minute.eql?(60.seconds)  # => true
        1.minute.eql?(60)          # => false

    *Joost Lubach*

*   `Time#change` can now change nanoseconds (`:nsec`) as a higher-precision
    alternative to microseconds (`:usec`).

    *Agis Anastasooulos*

*   `MessageVerifier.new` raises an appropriate exception if the secret is `nil`.
    This prevents `MessageVerifier#generate` from raising a cryptic error later on.

    *Kostiantyn Kahanskyi*

*   Introduced new configuration option `active_support.test_order` for
    specifying the order in which test cases are executed. This option currently defaults
    to `:sorted` but will be changed to `:random` in Rails 5.0.

    *Akira Matsuda*, *Godfrey Chan*

*   Fixed a bug in `Inflector#underscore` where acroynms in nested constant names
    are incorrectly parsed as camelCase.

    Fixes #8015.

    *Fred Wu*, *Matthew Draper*

*   Make `Time#change` throw an exception if the `:usec` option is out of range and
    the time has an offset other than UTC or local.

    *Agis Anastasopoulos*

*   `Method` objects now report themselves as not `duplicable?`. This allows
    hashes and arrays containing `Method` objects to be `deep_dup`ed.

    *Peter Jaros*

*   `determine_constant_from_test_name` does no longer shadow `NameError`s
    which happens during constant autoloading.

    Fixes #9933.

    *Guo Xiang Tan*

*   Added instance_eval version to Object#try and Object#try!, so you can do this:

        person.try { name.first }

    instead of:

        person.try { |person| person.name.first }

    *DHH*, *Ari Pollak*

*   Fix the `ActiveSupport::Duration#instance_of?` method to return the right
    value with the class itself since it was previously delegated to the
    internal value.

    *Robin Dupret*

*   Fix rounding errors with `#travel_to` by resetting the usec on any passed time to zero, so we only travel
    with per-second precision, not anything deeper than that.

    *DHH*

*   Fix DateTime comparison with `DateTime::Infinity` object.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Added Object#itself which returns the object itself. Useful when dealing with a chaining scenario, like Active Record scopes:

        Event.public_send(state.presence_in([ :trashed, :drafted ]) || :itself).order(:created_at)

    *DHH*

*   `Object#with_options` executes block in merging option context when
    explicit receiver in not passed.

    *Pavel Pravosud*

*   Fixed a compatibility issue with the `Oj` gem when cherry-picking the file
    `active_support/core_ext/object/json` without requiring `active_support/json`.

    Fixes #16131.

    *Godfrey Chan*

*   Make `Hash#with_indifferent_access` copy the default proc too.

    *arthurnn*, *Xanders*

*   Add `String#truncate_words` to truncate a string by a number of words.

    *Mohamed Osama*

*   Deprecate `capture` and `quietly`.

    These methods are not thread safe and may cause issues when used in threaded environments.
    To avoid problems we are deprecating them.

    *Tom Meier*

*   `DateTime#to_f` now preserves the fractional seconds instead of always
    rounding to `.0`.

    Fixes #15994.

    *John Paul Ashenfelter*

*   Add `Hash#transform_values` to simplify a common pattern where the values of a
    hash must change, but the keys are left the same.

    *Sean Griffin*

*   Always instrument `ActiveSupport::Cache`.

    Since `ActiveSupport::Notifications` only instruments items when there
    are attached subscribers, we don't need to disable instrumentation.

    *Peter Wagenet*

*   Make the `apply_inflections` method case-insensitive when checking
    whether a word is uncountable or not.

    *Robin Dupret*

*   Make Dependencies pass a name to NameError error.

    *arthurnn*

*   Fixed `ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore` exploding with long paths.

    *Adam Panzer*, *Michael Grosser*

*   Fixed `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#-` so precision is not unnecessarily lost
    when working with objects with a nanosecond component.

    `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#-` should return the same result as if we were
    using `Time#-`:

        Time.now.end_of_day - Time.now.beginning_of_day # => 86399.999999999

    Before:

        Time.zone.now.end_of_day.nsec # => 999999999
        Time.zone.now.end_of_day - Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day # => 86400.0

    After:

        Time.zone.now.end_of_day - Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day
        # => 86399.999999999

    *Gordon Chan*

*   Fixed precision error in NumberHelper when using Rationals.

    Before:

        ActiveSupport::NumberHelper.number_to_rounded Rational(1000, 3), precision: 2
        # => "330.00"

    After:

        ActiveSupport::NumberHelper.number_to_rounded Rational(1000, 3), precision: 2
        # => "333.33"

    See #15379.

    *Juanjo Bazán*

*   Removed deprecated `Numeric#ago` and friends

    Replacements:

        5.ago   => 5.seconds.ago
        5.until => 5.seconds.until
        5.since => 5.seconds.since
        5.from_now => 5.seconds.from_now

    See #12389 for the history and rationale behind this.

    *Godfrey Chan*

*   DateTime `advance` now supports partial days.

    Before:

        DateTime.now.advance(days: 1, hours: 12)

    After:

        DateTime.now.advance(days: 1.5)

    Fixes #12005.

    *Shay Davidson*

*   `Hash#deep_transform_keys` and `Hash#deep_transform_keys!` now transform hashes
    in nested arrays.  This change also applies to `Hash#deep_stringify_keys`,
    `Hash#deep_stringify_keys!`, `Hash#deep_symbolize_keys` and
    `Hash#deep_symbolize_keys!`.

    *OZAWA Sakuro*

*   Fixed confusing `DelegationError` in `Module#delegate`.

    See #15186.

    *Vladimir Yarotsky*

*   Fixed `ActiveSupport::Subscriber` so that no duplicate subscriber is created
    when a subscriber method is redefined.

    *Dennis Schön*

*   Remove deprecated string based terminators for `ActiveSupport::Callbacks`.

    *Eileen M. Uchitelle*

*   Fixed an issue when using
    `ActiveSupport::NumberHelper::NumberToDelimitedConverter` to
    convert a value that is an `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer` introduced
    in 2da9d67.

    See #15064.

    *Mark J. Titorenko*

*   `TimeZone#parse` defaults the day of the month to '1' if any other date
    components are specified. This is more consistent with the behavior of
    `Time#parse`.

    *Ulysse Carion*

*   `humanize` strips leading underscores, if any.

    Before:

        '_id'.humanize # => ""

    After:

        '_id'.humanize # => "Id"

    *Xavier Noria*

*   Fixed backward compatibility issues introduced in 326e652.

    Empty Hash or Array should not be present in serialization result.

        {a: []}.to_query # => ""
        {a: {}}.to_query # => ""

    For more info see #14948.

    *Bogdan Gusiev*

*   Add `Digest::UUID::uuid_v3` and `Digest::UUID::uuid_v5` to support stable
    UUID fixtures on PostgreSQL.

    *Roderick van Domburg*

*   Fixed `ActiveSupport::Duration#eql?` so that `1.second.eql?(1.second)` is
    true.

    This fixes the current situation of:

        1.second.eql?(1.second) # => false

    `eql?` also requires that the other object is an `ActiveSupport::Duration`.
    This requirement makes `ActiveSupport::Duration`'s behavior consistent with
    the behavior of Ruby's numeric types:

        1.eql?(1.0) # => false
        1.0.eql?(1) # => false

        1.second.eql?(1) # => false (was true)
        1.eql?(1.second) # => false

        { 1 => "foo", 1.0 => "bar" }
        # => { 1 => "foo", 1.0 => "bar" }

        { 1 => "foo", 1.second => "bar" }
        # now => { 1 => "foo", 1.second => "bar" }
        # was => { 1 => "bar" }

    And though the behavior of these hasn't changed, for reference:

        1 == 1.0 # => true
        1.0 == 1 # => true

        1 == 1.second # => true
        1.second == 1 # => true

    *Emily Dobervich*

*   `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer#prepend` acts like `String#prepend` and modifies
    instance in-place, returning self. `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer#prepend!` is
    deprecated.

    *Pavel Pravosud*

*   `HashWithIndifferentAccess` better respects `#to_hash` on objects it
    receives. In particular, `.new`, `#update`, `#merge`, and `#replace` accept
    objects which respond to `#to_hash`, even if those objects are not hashes
    directly.

    *Peter Jaros*

*   Deprecate `Class#superclass_delegating_accessor`, use `Class#class_attribute` instead.

    *Akshay Vishnoi*

*   Ensure classes which `include Enumerable` get `#to_json` in addition to
    `#as_json`.

    *Sammy Larbi*

*   Change the signature of `fetch_multi` to return a hash rather than an
    array. This makes it consistent with the output of `read_multi`.

    *Parker Selbert*

*   Introduce `Concern#class_methods` as a sleek alternative to clunky
    `module ClassMethods`. Add `Kernel#concern` to define at the toplevel
    without chunky `module Foo; extend ActiveSupport::Concern` boilerplate.

        # app/models/concerns/authentication.rb
        concern :Authentication do
          included do
            after_create :generate_private_key
          end

          class_methods do
            def authenticate(credentials)
              # ...
            end
          end

          def generate_private_key
            # ...
          end
        end

        # app/models/user.rb
        class User < ActiveRecord::Base
          include Authentication
        end
