# Reporting bugs

The best way to report a bug is by providing a reproduction script. A half
working script with comments for the parts you were unable to automate is still
appreciated.

In any case, specify following info in description of your issue:

- What you're trying to accomplish
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- The exception backtrace(s), if any
- Version of gem or commit ref you are using
- Version of ruby you are using
